### Technical Requirements

Backend: connects provides a API for React front end by performing CRUD operations on MongoDB using Mongoose package 
Frontend: Uses routes to display various React components, provides CRUD functions through forms and querying backend API.

#### Express
- API Crud endpoints interacting with minimum 1 model
- Endpoints use expected HTTP methods
    - GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
##### Mongoose & MongoDB
- minimum 1 mongoose model

#### React
- One parent component controlling one or more child components
- Provides CRUD operations through forms
- CRUD operations query backend (which in turn updates the database) for persistence
- Makes use of routes where appropriate

For example the blog app we have been working on in class meets this requirements, example project here: TBC

### Necessary Deliverables

- Project hosted on your personal github.com
- Project meets technical requirements
- README.md detailing 
    - Project setup instructions
    - Project run instructions
    - Issues you ran into during development
    - Improvements you would like to make in the future

### Suggested Ways to Get Started
Break the app down into sections, the back end (Express/Node/Mongoose) is a good place to start as it can be built as an API and
tested with Postman (or similar).

From there you can build the React front end integrating it with the backend as you go.
